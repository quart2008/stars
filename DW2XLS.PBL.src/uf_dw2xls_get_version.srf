/* * history * *

4.0
- Added support for the new Excel file format, OOXML (XML based Excel 2007 format)
  Set parm.is_version = "OOXML"
  Default is still 97.

- Added support for rectangles and solid lines (only vertical and horizontal). 
  Set parm.ib_lines and parm.ib_rectangles.
  These objects are emulated using slim cells. 
  Note, that if a line or a rectangle is too close to another cell, then it may be 
  displayed not properly in Excel.

- Added support for band background color and color expressions

- Added support for exporting more than one datawindow on a single sheet
  See doc/multidwexample.htm

- Overlapping objects are trimmed so that they do not overlap

- Grid column's header is not exported anymore if the column is hidden

3.2.3
- Fixed regression in 3.0.5 which caused creating of damaged XLS when some objects have negative coordinates 

3.2.2
- Fixed regression in 3.2.1 with height.autosize in detail band

3.2.1
- Fixed exporting of objects outside band bounds

3.2
- Added support for legacy user code which used some PB2XLS functions removed in DW2XLS 3.1.

- Added support for DataWindow.Print.Orientation

- Added support for <column>.Font.Escapement

3.1.9
- Fixed regression in 3.1.8

3.1.8
- Fixed multipart [currency] format processing

3.1.7
- The XLS header feature is now renamed to the XLS title. 
  All related parameters is_header_xxxxx were renamed as well to is_title_xxxxx.
  
- Fixed converting from Windows time format to Excel time format (added 'tt' to 'AM/PM')

- Fixed setting format for large string cells (>255 chars). Now it's forced to "General"

3.1.6
- Fixed check for Excel sheet limits: max. rows 65536, max. cols 256

3.1.5
- Added support for XLS header text. See the is_header_xxxxx parameters in n_dwr_servce_parm 

3.1.4
- Fixed processing of detail autosizeheight + detail height = 0 

3.1.3
- Basic Treeview DW support: only leafs (without level bands)
- Fixed regression in 3.1.X with conversion of ~r in strings

3.1.2
- fixed incorrect FreeLibrary declaration causing the PB2XLS.DLL stay in memory 
  until application exits
- fixed storing wrong strings in XLS

3.1.1
- fixed hide_grid option processing

3.1
- removed support for Excel5, only Excel97 is supported
- added support for font family and font charset properties
- considerably increased the performance, up to 400% for DWs without dynamic formatting properties

3.0.4
- Bands with height=0 are not exported any more

3.0.3
- Fixed null object reference after cancelling the export

3.0.2
- Increased the default values for slim cell merging: id_min_width = 0.5, id_min_height = 4.0

3.0.1
- Fixed OLE stream copy for large nested DW data
- Fixed empty computes in nested crosstabs

3.0
- Moved to C++ some code
- Excel columns that are tighter than the minimum column width are merged with the next column 
  and rows that are shorter than the minumum row height are merged with the next row.
  This is controlled by n_dwr_service_parm parameters, id_min_width and id_min_height.
- Removed the exponential dependence of export time 
  depending on number of rows. Now it's a linear dependence. 
- More support for nested DWs and/or expressions for X,Y,W,H.
  In the previous versions, some combinations of coordinates and expressions
  could cause improper cell merging in XLS.

2.1.1 
- Fixed 'page break on group change' handling 

2.1.0.2 
- Fields with width="0" are not exported

2.1.0.1 
- Fixed of_save_dw2sheet/of_save_ds2sheet metadata cache
